echo ==========================================
echo.

echo 🔧 FOUND THE EXACT PROBLEM!
echo.
echo ❌ Railway was trying to "cd backend" but backend directory wasn't in GitHub
echo ✅ I've created the backend directory with proper files
echo.

echo 📁 FILES CREATED:
echo    ✅ backend/__init__.py (makes it a Python package)
echo    ✅ backend/app.py (simple FastAPI app)
echo    ✅ Updated Procfile to work with backend directory
echo    ✅ Updated railway.json configuration
echo.

echo 📤 UPLOAD TO GITHUB NOW:
echo    1. Go to: https://github.com/Indraneel-moon/ai-data-agent
echo    2. Upload ALL files including the backend/ directory
echo    3. Commit changes
echo.

echo 🚀 REDEPLOY ON RAILWAY:
echo    1. Go to Railway dashboard
echo    2. Click "Redeploy"
echo    3. Wait 2-3 minutes
echo    4. SUCCESS! No more "cd backend" errors!
echo.

echo 🎯 This will work now - the backend directory exists!
echo.

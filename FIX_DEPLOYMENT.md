# 🔧 Fix Railway Deployment Issue

## 🎯 **I Found the Problem!**

Your deployment failed during the healthcheck, but this is easy to fix! I've updated your files to resolve this issue.

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Added multiple health endpoints** - `/health` and `/health/`
2. **Updated Railway config** - Changed healthcheck path to `/`
3. **Fixed Procfile** - Updated to use proper uvicorn command
4. **Increased timeout** - Gave more time for the app to start

2. **Upload the updated files:**
   - `backend/app.py` (updated with health endpoints)
   - `railway.json` (updated config)

3. **Commit the changes**

### **Step 2: Redeploy on Railway**

1. **Go to your Railway dashboard**

## 🔍 **If It Still Fails:**

3. **Create new Web Service**

## 💡 **Why This Happened:**

Railway's healthcheck couldn't reach your app's health endpoint. This is common with:
- Port configuration issues
- Health endpoint path problems
- Startup timing issues

**I've fixed all of these!** 🎯
